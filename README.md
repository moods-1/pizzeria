## Pizzeria Moodi

### This app was created as challenge to myself to create a project to tackle two subjects that were new to me. Those things were React JS and e-commerce. 

During the process of making this app, my mind had to be altered from doing things the standard way of web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. Learning how to combine the core web tools with all that comes with React was challenging at first, but the end result was worth it. 

### Project tools:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Node JS (NPM, NPX, create-react-app, etc...)
  - Git/GitHub
  - React
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - Javascript ES6
  - Paypal Sandbox SDK

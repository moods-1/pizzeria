## Pizzeria Moodi

### This app was created as challenge to myself to create an e-commerce project which went all the way through the payment process. 

The idea to create an app for a high-end pizzeria was sparked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that so many small businesses were suffering due to the fact that they had no web presence or they were not utilizing other modern ways of doing business.

  - Node JS (NPM, NPX, create-react-app, etc...)
